    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Try this authentic tandoori chicken that's marinated in yogurt and spices, then cooked on the grill instead of a clay oven so you can make it at home.</p>
    <p>Serve with long-grain basmati rice, grilled veggies, roasted corn on the cob, and a cucumber salad.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups plain yogurt</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces. Cut slits into meat and place into a shallow dish.<br> Season chicken on both sides with lemon juice and salt. Let sit for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala, ginger, and cayenne pepper together in a medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food coloring.<br> Spread yogurt mixture over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours (the longer the better).</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade.<br> Discard remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink and the juices run clear. <br>An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with cilantro and lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
